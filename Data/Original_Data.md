The original file consists of data scraped from the Craigslist automotive sales section for the entire country. According to the kaggle repository, the dataset was last updated in January of this year(2020). I am unable to load the file onto github, as the .csv is over a gig in size, totaling over half a million records with 25 features.

The link to download the dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/download

I filtered this dataset to remove all na values, as well as to only include vehicles found within my region. Further details about preprocessing can be found in the Data_Preprocessing.ipny Jupyter notebook.
